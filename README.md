# CS-320-Project

    This term, I enjoyed discovering JUnit Testing 
    and learning how to implement them into my project. 
    This not only shows me how my program will function, 
    but also increases security. With a code coverage 
    at or near 100%, you can be sure attackers woun't 
    be able to take advantage of weakspots in your 
    program for malicious purposes. JUnit testing was 
    also beneficial in ensuring that my code complies 
    with the clint's specifications. During the design 
    phase, special attention must be paid to what the 
    client wants to see as their final product, 
    eliminating any biases the developer may have 
    toward or against any of the clients' requirments.
